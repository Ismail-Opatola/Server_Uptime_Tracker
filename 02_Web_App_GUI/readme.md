Build a frontend webapp that interacts with the Json api we've been building in the previuos lectures

Learn how to:

- Use Node.js to build a frontend site
- interacts with JSON api
- Build a fully featured MVC using nodejs

Our GUI allows the user to:

- signup
- login and uot
- modify their account settings
- delete their account
- create, update and delete checks
- View the dashboard of all created checks and the status of those checks

First we need to refactor our existing app so that it can serve static assets.

Then we need to add lots of new public facining routes to our router and these would serve html to web browsers instaed of json responses via api

And the we need to create HTML templataes for our new pages

And frontend JS to capture form inputs and submit them to our API via AJAX
